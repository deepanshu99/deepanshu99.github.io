title: Learning Ruby 
---

Hello my beloved readers this is probably the most deeply thought post in writing. This is my first time so please don't hesitate to point out th errors.

I am learing Ruby so that I could learn Ruby on Rails afterwords.

So you might think why on earth am I learning Ruby on Rails when the entire world is shifting to Node.js and other such technologies. Well I wan't to learn it because I fell deeply in love how Jekyll works, although I don't understand the intricacies of Jekyll yet. Jekyll is also based on Ruby so I thought why not give it a try. 

Also I am not very proficient in Javascript (much afraid of the callback hell) and will have to learn everything from scratch again.

Creating variables is damn easy compared to JS.

Instead of `var oranges  = 10`

`oranges = 10 ` is used to declare and initialise the variable. 

For now I'm referring [learnrubythehardway.org](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book).
